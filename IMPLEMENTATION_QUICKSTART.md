# 🚀 MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION: QUICK START IMPLEMENTATION

## For Developers Who Want to Add This to Their Projects NOW

---

# ⚡ 5-Minute Setup

## Step 1: Copy the Orchestrator

```bash
# From this bootstrap project, copy the orchestrator template
cd /path/to/your/existing/project

# Copy orchestrator directory structure
cp -r /path/to/cc_bootstrap/.orchestrator ./.orchestrator

# Copy AGENTS.md template
cp /path/to/cc_bootstrap/AGENTS.md ./AGENTS.md

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x .orchestrator/commands/*.sh
```

## Step 2: Create Symlink

```bash
# Add orchestrate command to your PATH
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/.orchestrator/commands/orchestrate.sh" /usr/local/bin/orchestrate
```

## Step 3: Initialize GitHub Labels

```bash
# Run initialization
orchestrate init
```

That's it! You're ready to use multi-agent orchestration.

# 📋 First Orchestration (10 Minutes)

## Example: Build REST API with 3 Endpoints

### 1. Plan the Task

```bash
orchestrate plan "Build REST API with /users, /products, and /orders endpoints"
```

**What happens**:
- Claude Code analyzes the task
- Creates decomposition plan
- Shows you the plan
- Asks for approval

**You see**:
```
Proposed Decomposition:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subtask 1: Implement /users endpoint
  Duration: ~30 min
  Success Criteria: GET/POST work, tests pass

Subtask 2: Implement /products endpoint
  Duration: ~30 min
  Success Criteria: CRUD operations work, tests pass

Subtask 3: Implement /orders endpoint
  Duration: ~45 min
  Success Criteria: Order creation works, tests pass

Approve? (yes/no)
```

Type `yes` and press Enter.

### 2. Execute the Plan

```bash
orchestrate execute
```

**What happens**:
- 3 GitHub issues created (one per endpoint)
- 3 Claude Code processes spawned (one per issue)
- Each process works independently
- All progress tracked on GitHub

**You see**:
```
✓ Created issue #101: 🤖 [Subagent]: Implement /users endpoint
✓ Created issue #102: 🤖 [Subagent]: Implement /products endpoint
✓ Created issue #103: 🤖 [Subagent]: Implement /orders endpoint

✓ Spawned agent for issue #101 (PID: 12345)
✓ Spawned agent for issue #102 (PID: 12346)
✓ Spawned agent for issue #103 (PID: 12347)

Track progress: orchestrate status
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

```bash
orchestrate status
```

**What you see** (after 5 minutes):
```
📊 Multi-Agent Orchestration Status

Subagents:
┌────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Issue  │ Task                │ Status       │ Last Update  │
├────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ #101   │ /users endpoint     │ 🔄 WORKING   │ 1 min ago    │
│ #102   │ /products endpoint  │ 🔄 WORKING   │ 2 min ago    │
│ #103   │ /orders endpoint    │ 🔄 WORKING   │ 1 min ago    │
└────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

Progress: 0/3 completed (0%)
```

**After 30 minutes**:
```
Progress: 3/3 completed (100%)

All subagents completed! Ready for integration.
```

### 4. Integrate Results

```bash
orchestrate integrate
```

**What happens**:
- Collects code from all 3 subagents
- Spawns main Claude Code to synthesize
- Creates unified router
- Adds integration tests
- Creates summary issue
- Closes subagent issues

**You see**:
```
✅ Integration complete!

Created summary issue: #104

Deliverables:
  - src/api/users.py
  - src/api/products.py
  - src/api/orders.py
  - src/api/router.py
  - tests/test_api_integration.py

All tests pass: 12/12 ✓
```

### 5. Cleanup

```bash
orchestrate cleanup
```

**What happens**:
- Archives the orchestration
- Clears current state
- Closes GitHub issues
- Compresses logs

Done! Your REST API is complete, built in parallel by 3 agents.

# 🎯 When to Use Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Good Use Cases ✅

### 1. Independent Features
```bash
orchestrate plan "Add user authentication, email notifications, and file uploads"
# 3 independent features → perfect for parallel execution
```

### 2. Module-Based Work
```bash
orchestrate plan "Create admin dashboard, user dashboard, and reporting dashboard"
# 3 separate modules → each agent builds one
```

### 3. Data Analysis from Multiple Sources
```bash
orchestrate plan "Analyze database logs, API metrics, and user feedback"
# 3 data sources → parallel analysis
```

### 4. Documentation Sprints
```bash
orchestrate plan "Document API endpoints, database schema, and deployment process"
# 3 doc topics → parallel writing
```

## Bad Use Cases ❌

### 1. Sequential Dependencies
```bash
# ❌ Don't use for:
"Create database schema, then write migrations, then seed data"
# Must be sequential, no benefit from parallelization
```

### 2. Single Responsibility
```bash
# ❌ Don't use for:
"Fix bug in login function"
# Single, focused task, no decomposition needed
```

### 3. Highly Coupled Code
```bash
# ❌ Don't use for:
"Refactor authentication system"
# Too many interdependencies, integration conflicts likely
```

### 4. Trivial Tasks
```bash
# ❌ Don't use for:
"Add 3 simple utility functions"
# Overhead exceeds benefit
```

# 🔧 Customization

## Customize AGENTS.md for Your Project

Edit `AGENTS.md` to define your project-specific patterns:

```markdown
# 🤖 PROJECT AGENT CONFIGURATION

## Common Decomposition Patterns

### Pattern: New Feature
When adding a new feature with frontend + backend + tests:
- Subagent 1: Implement backend API
- Subagent 2: Implement frontend UI
- Subagent 3: Write integration tests

### Pattern: Bug Investigation
When investigating a complex bug:
- Subagent 1: Analyze backend logs
- Subagent 2: Analyze frontend errors
- Subagent 3: Review database queries

## Success Criteria Templates

### For Code Implementation
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No linting errors

### For Documentation
- [ ] Covers all required topics
- [ ] Includes code examples
- [ ] Reviewed for accuracy
- [ ] Follows doc template
```

## Configure Settings

Edit `.orchestrator/config.yaml`:

```yaml
orchestration:
  # Maximum concurrent subagents
  max_concurrent: 5

  # Status check interval (seconds)
  status_check_interval: 60

claude:
  # Subagent timeout (minutes)
  timeout: 60
```

---

# 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

## GitHub Issues Dashboard

All orchestration work is visible on GitHub:

```
https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/issues?q=is:issue+label:subagent-task
```

This shows:
- All subagent tasks
- Current status (pending/in-progress/completed)
- Recent activity
- Decisions made
- Blockers

## Real-Time Monitoring

For continuous monitoring:

```bash
watch -n 10 'orchestrate status'
```

This refreshes status every 10 seconds.

# 🚨 Troubleshooting

## Problem: Subagent Not Updating GitHub

**Check**:
```bash
gh auth status
```

**Fix**:
```bash
gh auth login
```

## Problem: "No plan found"

**Check**:
```bash
ls .orchestrator/state/current_plan.json
```

**Fix**:
```bash
orchestrate plan "your task description"
```

## Problem: Subagent Appears Stuck

**Check logs**:
```bash
tail -f .orchestrator/logs/agent_<issue-number>.log
```

**Check GitHub**:
```bash
gh issue view <issue-number> --comments
```

**Restart if needed**:
```bash
# Kill stuck process
kill <PID>

# Restart (future feature)
orchestrate restart <issue-number>
```

## Problem: Integration Conflicts

**Check what changed**:
```bash
git status
git diff
```

**Resolve conflicts**:
```bash
# Manually resolve in files
# Then continue integration
```

**Or abort and retry**:
```bash
git merge --abort
orchestrate cleanup

# Decompose differently to avoid overlap
orchestrate plan "revised decomposition..."
```

# 📈 Efficiency Gains

## Time Savings Example

### Traditional Sequential Development
```
Feature 1: 45 min
Feature 2: 45 min
Feature 3: 60 min
Integration: 30 min
Total: 3 hours
```

### Multi-Agent Parallel Development
```
All 3 features: 60 min (parallel)
Integration: 30 min
Total: 1.5 hours
```

**Savings**: 50% time reduction for 3+ independent tasks

## Quality Improvements

- **Transparency**: All decisions visible on GitHub
- **Reviewability**: Human oversight at every step
- **Auditability**: Complete history preserved
- **Parallelization**: Focused attention on each subtask
