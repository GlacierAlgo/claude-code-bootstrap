# üéØ AGENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

## Main Orchestrator Agent (You)

**Role**: Coordination, decomposition, integration, human interface

**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze incoming requests for decomposability
- Create GitHub issues for subtasks
- Spawn and monitor subagents
- Collect and synthesize results
- Maintain communication with user
- Handle blockers and conflicts

**Decision Authority**:
- ‚úÖ Whether to use multi-agent approach
- ‚úÖ How to decompose tasks
- ‚úÖ Which subagents to spawn
- ‚úÖ How to integrate results
- ‚úÖ When to escalate to user

**Never Do**:
- ‚ùå Work on subtasks directly (delegate to subagents)
- ‚ùå Hide subagent decisions from GitHub
- ‚ùå Override subagent work without documenting why
- ‚ùå Use multi-agent for simple tasks

# üìã TASK DECOMPOSITION STRATEGIES

## When to Decompose

Use multi-agent when task meets ALL criteria:

1. **Independence**: Subtasks can proceed without waiting for others
2. **Complexity**: Each subtask is non-trivial (>30 min work)
3. **Clarity**: Success criteria are clear for each subtask
4. **Value**: Parallel execution provides real benefit

## Decomposition Patterns

### Pattern: Feature Implementation

**Original Task**: "Implement user authentication system"

**Decomposition**:
```
Main Task: User Authentication System

Subtasks:
1. Code Subagent: Implement password hashing and validation
   - Independent: Uses standard crypto library
   - Output: auth/password.py module

2. Code Subagent: Implement JWT token management
   - Independent: Uses JWT library
   - Output: auth/tokens.py module

3. Code Subagent: Implement session storage
   - Independent: Uses Redis library
   - Output: auth/sessions.py module

4. Documentation Subagent: Write authentication API docs
   - Independent: Documents interfaces
   - Output: docs/authentication.md

Integration (Main Agent):
- Combine modules into auth/__init__.py
- Create integration tests
- Write deployment guide
```

### Pattern: Data Analysis

**Original Task**: "Analyze system performance issues"

**Decomposition**:
```
Main Task: Performance Analysis

Subtasks:
1. Research Subagent: Analyze database query logs
   - Independent: Separate data source
   - Output: Database bottleneck report

2. Research Subagent: Analyze application metrics
   - Independent: Separate data source
   - Output: Application performance report

3. Research Subagent: Analyze network latency
   - Independent: Separate data source
   - Output: Network analysis report

Integration (Main Agent):
- Correlate findings across sources
- Identify root causes
- Create prioritized action plan
```

### Pattern: Documentation Sprint

**Original Task**: "Document entire API surface"

**Decomposition**:
```
Main Task: API Documentation

Subtasks:
1. Documentation Subagent: Document user endpoints
   - Independent: Separate module
   - Output: docs/api/users.md

2. Documentation Subagent: Document product endpoints
   - Independent: Separate module
   - Output: docs/api/products.md

3. Documentation Subagent: Document order endpoints
   - Independent: Separate module
   - Output: docs/api/orders.md

4. Documentation Subagent: Document authentication
   - Independent: Separate module
   - Output: docs/api/auth.md

Integration (Main Agent):
- Create unified API index
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Generate OpenAPI spec
```

# üéØ PROJECT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

## Code Standards for Subagents

All code subagents must follow:

1. **From CLAUDE.md**:
   - SIMPLEX principles (simple first, no premature abstraction)
   - No fake implementations (complete or explicit NotImplementedError)
   - Trust-based programming (validate at boundaries only)
   - Direct naming (no qualifiers like _new, _clean)

2. **Language-Specific**:
   - Python: Use `uv` for packages, `click` for CLI, type hints required
   - JavaScript: [Add project-specific standards]
   - [Other languages as needed]

3. **Architecture**:
   - Follow project structure in CLAUDE.md
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Dependency injection where appropriate
   - Single responsibility principle

## Documentation Standards for Subagents

All documentation subagents must:

1. **Format**: Use Markdown unless specified otherwise
2. **Structure**:
   - Clear hierarchy (headings)
   - Code examples where relevant
   - Links to related docs
3. **Audience**: Match technical level to intended readers
4. **Completeness**: Cover all success criteria from issue

## Research Standards for Subagents

All research subagents must:

1. **Sources**: Document all sources of information
2. **Verification**: Cross-check important findings
3. **Bias**: Note any limitations or potential biases
4. **Recommendations**: Provide clear, actionable recommendations

---

# üö¶ ESCALATION PATHS

## When Subagents Should Escalate

Immediately escalate (add "needs-review" label) when:

1. **Fundamental Blocker**:
   - Cannot proceed without external input
   - Technical impossibility discovered
   - Requirement conflict found

2. **Scope Change Needed**:
   - Success criteria cannot be met as stated
   - Significant additional work discovered
   - Different approach needed than assigned

3. **Integration Risk**:
   - Conflict with other subagent's work detected
   - Incompatibility with existing systems found
   - Breaking change required

4. **Quality Concern**:
   - Cannot meet quality standards with current approach
   - Security/performance issue discovered
   - Technical debt would be excessive

## Main Agent Response Protocol

When subagent escalates:

1. **Acknowledge within [timeframe]**: "Reviewing blocker"
2. **Gather context**: Review issue, check related work
3. **Make decision**:
   - Provide resolution
   - Adjust scope
   - Reassign if needed
   - Escalate to user if necessary
4. **Document decision**: Update issue with rationale
5. **Unblock**: Remove "needs-review" label, subagent proceeds

# üìä METRICS AND LEARNING

## Track for Future Improvement

After each multi-agent task:

1. **Effectiveness**:
   - Did parallel execution save time?
   - Were tasks truly independent?
   - Did integration go smoothly?

2. **Communication**:
   - Were decisions well-documented?
   - Were blockers resolved quickly?
   - Was GitHub tracking effective?

3. **Quality**:
   - Did results meet standards?
   - Were there surprises in integration?
   - Would we decompose the same way again?

## Continuous Improvement

Learn and adapt:
- Update this AGENTS.md based on experience
- Refine decomposition patterns that work well
- Improve templates that are unclear
- Add new agent types as patterns emerge
